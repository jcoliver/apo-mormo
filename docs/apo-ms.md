## Abstract

## Introduction
Genetic markers have long been looked to for setting management policies, largely with the intent of applying objective criteria to identify taxa of conservation priority (REFS in [Allendorf 2016](#allendorf-2016)). Genetic differentiation or genetic 'uniqueness' has been used with a variety of descriptions, including Evolutionary Significant Units (REF), Distinct Population Segments (REF), and Management Units [Moritz 1994](#moritz-1994). Criteria for defining populations warranting conservation action include reciprocal monophyly (REF) and significant differences in allele frequencies, applying one of a number of tests for genetic differentiation (REF). Such approaches have mixed results, with some genetic analyses corroborating other evidence supporting the distinctness of a taxon (REF), some suggesting no genetic differentiation of populations already under conservation focus (REF), and some identifying previously unrecognized genetic lineages ('cryptic diversity') (REF).




1. Bigger question: Genetics in ESU (DPS: Distinct Population Segments)
    + See also Management Units of Mortiz 1994
2. Next-gen in ESU, see commentary by Allendorf Mol. Ecol. 2016, no longer single or handful of markers, which could miss genetic variation... (see Toews & Brelsford 2012 referenced in Allendorf 2016)
3. Introduce the system. What do we know about population subdivision
4. Touch on taxonomic mess that is A. mormo s.l.
5. Rough outline of what we did
