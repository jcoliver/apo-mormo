## Abstract

## Introduction
Genetic markers have long been looked to for setting management policies, largely with the intent of applying objective criteria to identify taxa of conservation priority (REFS in [Allendorf 2016](#allendorf-2016)). Genetic differentiation or genetic 'uniqueness' has been used with a variety of descriptions, including Evolutionary Significant Units ([Ryder 1986](#ryder-1986)), Distinct Population Segments ([U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1996](#usfws-1996)), and Management Units [Moritz 1994](#moritz-1994). Criteria for defining populations warranting conservation action include reciprocal monophyly and significant differences in allele frequencies, applying one of a number of tests for genetic differentiation ([Moritz 1994](#moritz-1994)). Such approaches have mixed results, with some genetic analyses corroborating other evidence supporting the distinctness of a taxon ([Travis et al. 1996](#travis-et-al-1996)), some suggesting no genetic differentiation of populations already under conservation focus (REF), and some identifying previously unrecognized genetic lineages ('cryptic diversity') ([Yoder et al. 2002](#yoder-et-al-2002)).

Many of the early challenges to the use of genetic markers in prioritizing conservation efforts were due to a relatively small sampling of genetic markers. Indeed, many studies relied on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which has the benefit of a relatively high substitution rate, but is a single, non-recombining marker inherited from a single parent. Advances in genetic assays, especially next-generation sequencing technologies, have provided a means to overcome the problems associated with assays based on a trivial portion of the genome ([Allendorf 2016](#allendorf-2016)). Increasing the number of markers by orders of magnitude has made it less likely to miss important genetic variation due to insufficient sampling (REF). Furthermore, deeper coverage of genomes affords insights into previously undetectable selective pressures (REF) and demographic processes (REF). Here we apply next-generation sequencing to an endangered insect, in an effort to provide information useful to conservation priorities. Specifically we assess the support for genetic differentiation and the relationship to other populations and taxa.

The Mormon Metalmark species complex includes _Apodemia mormo_ (Felder & Felder), _A. virgulti_ (Behr), _A. mejicanus_ (Behr) (Lepidoptera: Riodinidae). This complex is distributed across western North America and is characterized by considerable among-population variation in phenology and wing pattern morphology ([Opler & Powell 1961](#opler-powell-1961); Scott 1986; Pratt & Ballmer 1991, Opler & Wright? More?). Most populations feed on species of wild buckwheat, _Eriogonum_ (Michaux) (Polygonaceae) as caterpillars, and adults often do not stray far from host plants. [**REVISE**] While there is also substantial among-population variation in caterpillar host-plant use, additional factors also limit habitat occupancy ([Wick et al. 2014](#wick-et-al-2014)), resulting in a relatively localized distribution pattern of this widespread complex (Scott 1984?). The variation in morphology and behavior has contributed to a proliferation of a number of taxonomic entities being described ([Opler & Powell 1961](#opler-powell-1961)): there are at least 17 currently subspecies in the complex (Pelham's Catalog), some of which occur syntopically ([Pratt & Ballmer 1991](#pratt-ballmer-1991)). In some cases, this variation is accompanied by genetic differentiation, in some cases over relatively small geographic scales ([Crawford et al. 2011](#crawford-et-al-2011), [Proshek et al. 2013](#proshek-et-al-2013)), and a number of populations in this species complex are under or are being considered for conservation protection ([Crawford et al. 2011](#crawford-et-al-2011), [Proshek et al. 2013](#proshek-et-al-2013), [Proshek et al. 2015](#proshek-et-al-2015)).

The focus of this work is the endangered subspecies, Lange's metalmark, _Apodemia mormo langei_ (Comstock), which is currently restricted to the Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge (REF). This univoltine entity feeds on _Eriogonum nudum auriculatum_ (AUTHORITY & CHECK), and although it was never widespread, it was historically distributed across sand dunes along the Sacramento River (REF).

1. Bigger question: Genetics in ESU (DPS: Distinct Population Segments)
    + See also Management Units of Mortiz 1994
2. Next-gen in ESU, see commentary by Allendorf Mol. Ecol. 2016, no longer single or handful of markers, which could miss genetic variation... (see Toews & Brelsford 2012 referenced in Allendorf 2016)
3. Introduce _A. mormo_. What do we know about population subdivision in _A. mormo_, touch on taxonomic mess that is _A. mormo s.l._
4. Focus on _A. mormo langei_.
    + Some basic biology
