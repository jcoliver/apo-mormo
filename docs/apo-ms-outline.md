## Text
1. Introduction
    1. Bigger question: Genetics in ESU (DPS: Distinct Population Segments)
        + See also Management Units of Mortiz 1994
    2. Next-gen in ESU, see commentary by Allendorf Mol. Ecol. 2016, no longer single or handful of markers, which could miss genetic variation... (see Toews & Brelsford 2012 referenced in Allendorf 2016)
    3. Introduce _A. mormo_. What do we know about population subdivision in _A. mormo_, touch on taxonomic mess that is _A. mormo s.l._
    4. Focus on _A. mormo langei_.
        + Some basic biology
        + What questions did we ask?
        + What methods did we use?
2. Materials & Methods
    1. Specimen acquisition & storage (JD, FAS)
    2. Extraction & amplification (JD)
    3. Data processing (JD)
    4. Analyses
        1. Inclusion/exclusion of certain samples? (i.e. Dockweiler, GNPSK)
        2. STRUCTURE (JD)
        3. SNAPP (JD)
        4. Unique alleles (JCO)
        5. FIS? (JCO)
        6. IBD (JCO)
        7. AMOVA? See Klicka et al. 2016. (JCO)
3. Results
    1. STRUCTURE (JD, JO)
    2. SNAPP (JD, JO)
    3. Unique alleles (JD, JO)
    4. IBD (JD, JO)
4. Discussion
    1. Overview: Populations differentiated; large north/south split, and large pairwise-FST
    2. Discuss North / South split in regards to taxonomy, but missing samples from intervening areas
    3. Everyone is special – all populations differentiated
        + See Pearse 2016 (cited in [Allendorf 2016](#allendorf-2016)) for "ignoring what we cannot detect"
        + Discuss the difference between population structure and species _a la_ recent Knowles paper in PNAS ([doi: 10.1073/pnas.1607921114](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607921114))?
    4. Why such high differentiation – put this in context of other insect GBS studies. Other factors besides host plant ([Wick et al. 2014](#wick-et-al-2014)). How many private alleles do they usually have? What is pairwise FST?
