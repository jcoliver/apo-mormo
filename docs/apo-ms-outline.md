## Text
1. Introduction
    1. Bigger question: Genetics in ESU (DPS: Distinct Population Segments)
        + See also Management Units of Mortiz 1994
    2. Next-gen in ESU, see commentary by Allendorf Mol. Ecol. 2016, no longer single or handful of markers, which could miss genetic variation... (see Toews & Brelsford 2012 referenced in Allendorf 2016)
    3. Introduce the system. What do we know about population subdivision in A. mormo (same as/ combine with #4?)
    4. Touch on taxonomic mess that is A. mormo s.l.
    5. Rough outline of what we did
2. Materials & Methods
    1. Specimen acquisition & storage
    2. Extraction & amplification
    3. Data processing
    4. Analyses
        1. Inclusion/exclusion of certain samples?
        2. STRUCTURE
        3. SNAPP
        4. Unique alleles
        5. FIS?
        6. IBD
        7. AMOVA? See Klicka et al. 2016.
3. Results
    1. STRUCTURE
    2. SNAPP
    3. Unique alleles
    4. IBD
4. Discussion
    1. Populations differentiated; large north/south split, and large pairwise-FST
    2. North / South some taxonomy, but missing samples from intervening areas
    3. Everyone is special – all populations differentiated
        + See Pearse 2016 (cited in Allendorf 2016) for "ignoring what we cannot detect"
    4. Why such high differentiation – put this in context of other insect GBS studies. Other factors besides host plant (Wick et al. 2014). How many private alleles do they usually have? What is pairwise FST?
